We are exploring the Kaggle Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 10 competition, specifically the Loan Approval Prediction challenge. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points for the competition:

Competition Overview:
Goal: Predict whether an applicant is approved for a loan.
Dataset: Tabular data, likely involving applicant information such as age, income, credit score, and so on.
Evaluation Metric: The submissions are evaluated using Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC). This metric evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between the positive (approved) and negative (not approved) classes based on predicted probabilities.

Dataset Details:
Synthetic Data: The data is synthetically generated, meaning it closely resembles real-world data but does not use any actual personal information.
Features: Features likely involve various financial and demographic information about the loan applicants.

Evaluation Metric:
AUC-ROC: This metric is particularly useful for binary classification problems (like loan approval) where you want to assess the model's performance in distinguishing between the two classes (approved vs. not approved). The score ranges from 0 to 1, where a score closer to 1 indicates better model performance.

Steps Performed in the Jupyter File:
1. Importing Necessary Libraries
2. Loading the Data
3. EDA
4. Data Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values and Outilier detection and removal)
5. Model Building - Catgbm
6. Model Evaluation
7. Final Model training and Predictions
